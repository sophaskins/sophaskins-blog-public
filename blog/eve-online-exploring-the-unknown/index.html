                <p>In my free time, sometimes I play the <strong>online RPG &ldquo;EVE Online&rdquo;</strong>. It&rsquo;s a game <a href="http://www.polygon.com/features/2016/6/11/11903768/eve-online-s-world-war-explained">notorious</a> for being a <strong>sandbox</strong> - anything goes, which makes for grand strategy, espionage, betrayal, and camaraderie. Recently, the game became <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/alpha-omega/">Free-to-Play</a>, hopefully injecting some fresh faces in to the (over a decade-old!) game. I had a blast over the past few days and felt like maybe I had a story worth telling.</p>
<p>While most EVE players live, kill, and die in <strong>Known Space</strong> (the Universe you see <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map">here</a>), my Corporation lives in <strong>Wormhole Space</strong> - a parallel galaxy with a twist. Known Space (&ldquo;K-space&rdquo;) is made of solar systems connected by Stargates, like the region of <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Solitude#sec">Solitude</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DVyiS5w.gif" alt="solitude"></p>
<p>Wormhole Space (&ldquo;J-Space&rdquo;) doesn&rsquo;t have Stargates. Instead, each J-Space star system is known to have a connection (or two!) to a particular <em>kind</em> of other system (called a <strong>static connection</strong> - read more <a href="http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_Space">here</a>) - <em>which</em> system of that kind it is <strong>changes every day</strong>. It takes a second to wrap your brain around, but once you do the concept is attractive - if your <strong>neighbors change every day</strong>, so too do the fights you get, the resources you can exploit, and your ease of resupply.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the static connection in my corporation&rsquo;s home system led directly to the <strong>home system of a prominent Wormholer Corporation</strong>: <a href="http://www.torpedodelivery.com/">Wingspan Enterprises</a>. The denizens of J-Space range from the fabulously wealthy and dangerous (<a href="https://hardknocksinc.net/">Hard Knocks</a>) to neutral explorers (<a href="https://www.eve-scout.com/signal-cartel/">Signal Cartel</a>) - Wingspan have a reputation for being persistent at low-level harassment. If I were to go looking for PvP action or work on making money doing PvE, they&rsquo;d quite effectively hunt me down and <strong>put me out of my misery</strong>. Staying home wasn&rsquo;t an option.</p>
<p>My corp&rsquo;s home hole has other connections, though, so I took one that led to <strong>Null-Security</strong> Known Space. In &ldquo;nullsec&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s no space cops to come avenge you if someone shoots you - <strong>EVE at its most fundamental</strong>. In addition to PvP combat, nullsec is a great place to do one of my favorite EVE activities: <strong>exploration</strong>. In EVE, exploration entails flying around looking for &ldquo;Cosmic Signatures&rdquo; - signals that there might be treasure nearby. You do a scanning minigame to pinpoint the nature and location of the Signatures:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VaGPmvl.jpg!" alt="scanning"></p>
<p><em>shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://www.pauljoyce.co.uk/2015/eve-online-weeks/">http://www.pauljoyce.co.uk/2015/eve-online-weeks/</a></em></p>
<p>and (if its the right category of site) doing a &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; minigame to unlock space treasure chests:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GJhBF9v.jpg" alt="hacking"></p>
<p><em>from CCP&rsquo;s website</em></p>
<p>I like the mix of activities involved in exploration - the minigames requires a decent amount of finesse, you have to travel through a large amount of space to find Signatures, and there&rsquo;s <strong>skill in not getting killed</strong> by angry locals, people camping the Exploration Sites, or PvPers out roaming. It can make a pretty penny, too - I find it more engaging than other forms of PvE.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Catch#sec">region</a> of space where the wormhole deposited me is known for having particularly valuable exploration loot. I gorged myself and collected <strong>~100 Million ISK</strong> worth of loot before deciding to call it a night. I headed home through the same wormhole, but I <strong>hit a bug</strong>! The game held me, stuck between the nullsec K-Space system and a path home in J-Space. I stayed stuck for about 10 minutes and decided to give up and log off - hoping I&rsquo;d still be alive the next day (read more about logging off mechanics and why I might not have still been alive <a href="https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203208932-Weapon-and-Logoff-Timers">here</a>).</p>
<p><em>a day passes</em></p>
<p>When I logged in, I was thankfully still alive, but the <strong>wormhole connections had dissipated</strong>. I set out to find another, but wasn&rsquo;t averse to doing a little more exploration along the way. Randomness can be a cruel mistress, but sometimes it&rsquo;s generous - while trying to find a wormhole home, I looted a <strong>further 300 Million ISK</strong> worth of treasure! For comparison, the 400 MM ISK in my ships hold could buy me the ship I was in (well kitted-out for exploration) more than <em>six times over</em>!</p>
<p>With that much value in my ship&rsquo;s hold, though, I was getting antsy. Nullsec <a href="http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/System_Security">isn&rsquo;t safe</a> - the next system over could be a trap. If my ship were to be blown up, I&rsquo;d lose all the loot (and worse! give it to those that killed me!). Not finding any wormhole pathways home, I decided to make a <strong>long 40 jump trip through K-Space</strong> out of nulllsec towards High Security space (where the odds of being ganked are much <em>much</em> lower, due to the all-powerful space police, <a href="https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203208902-CONCORD">CONCORD</a>). The people living where I was flying are (apparently) mostly European, so they were asleep - it was smooth sailing until I got to the final nullsec system. I entered through the stargate and saw this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8KfMb7t.png" alt="gatecamp"></p>
<p>A <a href="http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gatecamps">gatecamp</a>. The ships you see on my &ldquo;Overview&rdquo; (the readout on the right-hand side) are all hanging around this stargate, waiting for someone to come through. They use &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; (a <a href="http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Interdiction_101">mechanism</a> for holding enemies in place) to make sure you can&rsquo;t run, then unceremoniously kill you. You can&rsquo;t see my ship in the screenshot, but its to the lower left - <em>just</em> outside the bubble you can see on the right half of the screen. I wasn&rsquo;t trapped. <strong>I had a shot.</strong></p>
<p>I hit my afterburner, aligned towards the next stargate, and prayed I&rsquo;d make warp. <strong>Two days of loot on the table</strong> - a cool 400 MM ISK. The campers launched another bubble, landing mere meters from my ship! They were closing in - at about 10km they would be able to hold me in place without their bubbles, so it was seconds before I&rsquo;d die a fiery death.</p>
<p>Then I made warp. <strong>I was free</strong>, heading towards the next gate - a path to hisec.</p>
<p>Once I caught my breath, I opened up a conversation with one of the gatecampers:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3uqbYoO.png" alt="conversation"></p>
<p>We shared a chuckle at how narrowly I got away, and how much loot they missed out on. I still had 30 more jumps before I could sell off the loot at a <a href="http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Trade_Hubs">trade hub</a> and head to my home hole, but I&rsquo;d make it. It was all mine.</p>

                <h2 id="what-is-the-recurse-center">What is the Recurse Center?</h2>
<p>The long answer is: see how the Recurse Center <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about">describes itself</a>.</p>
<p>A shorter answer is that, to me, its most important attributes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s a <strong>retreat for programmers</strong> to focus on honing their skills</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s <strong>self-directed learning</strong>, not a curriculum of lectures and assignments</li>
<li>it <strong>happens in batches</strong> of attendees who start at the same time and (usually) finish at the same time</li>
<li>attendees have a <strong>variety of skill levels</strong> - some have been programming much less than a year, some have been programming more than three decades</li>
<li>its <strong>social norms</strong> are structured to make it a safe place to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, to ask questions, and to learn. It&rsquo;s <em>not</em> a place to show-off or brag of your nerd-dominance</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-did-i-go">Why did I go?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on the periphery of the Recurse Center (a.k.a. RC) for years. I worked at Etsy when they first provided space for RC&rsquo;s Summer 2012 batch - through that relationship, I:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>interviewed several Recursers</strong> for full-time positions after their batch was over</li>
<li>regularly <strong>had lunch with participants</strong> while RC was in session (because they shared our office space)</li>
<li>eventually <strong>became close friends</strong> with some of the Recursers and added new RC-filled spheres to my social scene</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the RC-ers I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be friends with are <strong>incredible people</strong> - they&rsquo;re smart, considerate of others in their actions, curious, and creative. I want to be like them when I grow up!</p>
<p>I had never attended, though. <strong>Three months for a batch is a long time!</strong> I&rsquo;ve had a few years of trouble finding the right job (thankfully I&rsquo;m feeling happy and settled now) and that meant I seldom had money saved up in-between jobs to go to RC <em>and</em> comfortably look for a job.</p>
<p>In November of last year, RC <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/121-come-to-rc-for-a-one-week-retreat">announced</a> that they&rsquo;d be experimenting with &ldquo;mini&rdquo; one-week batches. Being away from work for just <strong>one week felt very reasonable</strong> - it&rsquo;s about as disruptive as going to a conference, but much more educational! It seemed like my time had come!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">yo who wants to apply to mini1 2018 with me <a href="https://t.co/bdBBVP4AzK">https://t.co/bdBBVP4AzK</a></p>&mdash; cron mom (@sophaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/929375967868522496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="my-project">My project</h2>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve picked up bits and pieces about how <strong>pre-emptive multitasking</strong> works - a few details about timer interrupts here, a couple bits about saving registers there. My goal in my week at RC was to <strong>deepen my knowledge of multitasking</strong>.</p>
<p>Exploration started with the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">sources</a>. I poked around, grepped for words that I knew, and tried to find the code that implemented parts of the process I knew about. One of my batchmates pointed me towards Robert Love&rsquo;s <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Development-Robert-Love/dp/0672329468/">Linux Kernel Development</a> - an amazingly well written exploration of the internals of the Kernel. I dove in and took lots of notes!</p>
<p>Boosted by what I had learned in the sources and reading that book, I started doing <strong>experiments</strong>. I learn best when I can see the parts moving - my hope was to run various workloads and see observe how they are run. I <a href="https://github.com/sophaskins/linux-multitasking-exploration/blob/master/fake-process/fake-process.go">wrote a program</a> that does configurable amounts of busy work, <a href="https://github.com/sophaskins/linux-multitasking-exploration/blob/master/collect-stats/stats.py">a script</a> to scrape some statistics about scheduling, and a <a href="https://github.com/sophaskins/linux-multitasking-exploration/tree/master/experiments">few different</a> scenarios. From there I was able to make some <a href="https://github.com/sophaskins/linux-multitasking-exploration/blob/master/Process%20stats.ipynb">fascinating graphs</a></p>
<p>Most of my results were as expected (if you run identical processes, they get scheduled similarly; if processes do less work, they end up with less time on CPU) which is rad! I did have one suprising result - when running both a &ldquo;full&rdquo; load <em>and</em> a process running using the <code>IDLE</code> scheduler I expected the <code>IDLE</code> process to get <em>no</em> CPU time, but it got some! Something to dig deeper on!</p>
<h2 id="conversations">Conversations</h2>
<p>In only one week it&rsquo;s hard to go <em>too</em> deep in to a project. For me, the conversations I had and relationships I built were more important. I spent a lot of time listening to what others were working on - and <strong>learned so much</strong> by doing so. My batchmates were able to work on projects that they were <strong>deeply curious and excited about</strong> because of RC&rsquo;s structure. The social rules make a space where they could share and be vulnerable about what was frustrating or exciting or surprising or new.</p>
<p>I got to hear about generative puzzles, ReactJS, the insides of LLVM, 8-bit game programming, map generation, debugging tools, distributed file systems, pure-CSS graphics, first steps in functional programming, encryption, and much more. I was able to share expertise with Kubernetes, distributed systems, and serve as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber-duck</a>.</p>
<h2 id="feelings">Feelings</h2>
<p>The night before my batch started, I was re-reading the RC <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual">User&rsquo;s Manual</a> and having doubts. Some doubt was my suspicion of the &ldquo;unschooling&rdquo; movement, something I heard echos of in RC&rsquo;s self-driven design. A bigger part was the mission itself: &ldquo;to get dramatically better at programming&rdquo;. <strong>Did I even <em>want</em> to get better at programming?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A lot of bad things in the world have been created by programmers</strong>: software for operating drones that bomb civilians, data-mining that violates privacy, companies that &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; by dropping vast amounts of capital in to a market without any intention of building a sustainable business. <strong>A lot of bad <em>people</em> love programming</strong>: open source thought leaders who harbor deeply racist views, authors of popular databases who discuss their sexist ideas openly, neo-reactionaries leading functional programming conferences. <strong>The norms of programmer culture still revolve around using needless complexity as a cloak of wizardry.</strong> I don&rsquo;t think programming <em>skill</em> is particularly important in my job, so why am I even doing this?</p>
<p><strong>My fears were not realized</strong>. That may be what programming is in the world, but that&rsquo;s not what it is at the Recurse Center. I am still skeptical of <em>replacing</em> organized schooling with self-directed unschooling, but the Recurse Center isn&rsquo;t a <em>replacement</em> for anything - it stands on its own. Through the emotions of my batchmates, the incredible safety to learn provided by the social rules, and the focus provided by taking time apart from work <strong>I re-learned to love programming</strong>. As I took the train home after my final day, my thoughts were:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amidst constant reminders that tech is a toxic sewer, if you were looking for where the heart, the artistry, the skills, the soul of programming is:<br><br>It’s at the Recurse Center</p>&mdash; cron mom (@sophaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/951972297975443457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>There can be good in programmers. There can be joy in programming. I want to find those things - I want to continue to learn and to share and to share <em>in</em>.</p>
